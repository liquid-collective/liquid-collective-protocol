     * @notice Used for depositing an asset into the specified strategy with the resultant shares credited to `staker`,
     * who must sign off on the action.
     * Note that the assets are transferred out/from the `msg.sender`, not from the `staker`; this function is explicitly designed
     * purely to help one address deposit 'for' another.
     * @param strategy is the specified strategy where deposit is to be made,
     * @param token is the denomination in which the deposit is to be made,
     * @param amount is the amount of token to be deposited in the strategy by the staker
     * @param staker the staker that the deposited assets will be credited to
     * @param expiry the timestamp at which the signature expires
     * @param signature is a valid signature from the `staker`. either an ECDSA signature if the `staker` is an EOA, or data to forward
     * following EIP-1271 if the `staker` is a contract
     * @return shares The amount of new shares in the `strategy` created as part of the action.
     * @dev The `msg.sender` must have previously approved this contract to transfer at least `amount` of `token` on their behalf.
     * @dev A signature is required for this function to eliminate the possibility of griefing attacks, specifically those
     * targeting stakers who may be attempting to undelegate.
     * @dev Cannot be called if thirdPartyTransfersForbidden is set to true for this strategy
     *
     *  WARNING: Depositing tokens that allow reentrancy (eg. ERC-777) into a strategy is not recommended.  This can lead to attack vectors
     *          where the token balance and corresponding strategy shares are not in sync upon reentrancy
