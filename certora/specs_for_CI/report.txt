Rules for Alluvial CI:

confs: certora/confs_for_CI
specs: certora/specs_for_CI
 - references other specs from certora/specs

The rules:
I used all existing rules that are verified on current version of the code
Rules that timeout or cause errors have been discarted
Parametric rules that timeout on a particular method have been adjusted: the timing out methods will not be run. There are two such adjustments: 
    - RedeemManagerV1_for_CI.spec > full_claim_is_terminal_witness_nontrivial_consequent
	    method claimRedeemRequests(uint32[],uint32[]) was filtered out in the rules
    - SharesManagerV1_for_CI.spec
        there's a predicate excludedInCI(method f) used as a filter in parametric rules
        the predicate excludes method depositToConsensusLayerWithDepositRoot

runCI_confs.sh: simple script for running all the confs. For each conf there is a recent run link included

Currently, the certora/specs_for_CI/OperatorRegistryV1_for_CI_3.spec times out for there are too many rules. I'll split it into several smaller ones.
